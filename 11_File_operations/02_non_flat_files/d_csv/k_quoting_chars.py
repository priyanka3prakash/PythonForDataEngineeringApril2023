Formatting a csv file
-----------------------
- quotechar
    - a one-character string to use as the quoting character.
    - It defaults to '"'.
    - Setting this to None has the same effect as setting quoting to csv.QUOTE_NONE.
- delimiter
    - a one-character string to use as the field separator.
    - It defaults to ','.
- escapechar
    - a one-character string used to escape the delimiter when quotechar is set to None.
- skipinitialspace
    - how to interpret whitespace which immediately follows a delimiter.
    - It defaults to False, which means that whitespace immediately following a delimiter is part of the following field.
- lineterminator
    - the character sequence which should terminate rows.
- quoting controls when quotes should be generated by the writer. It can take on any of the following module constants:
    - csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL means only when required, for example, when a field contains either the quotechar or the delimiter
    - csv.QUOTE_ALL means that quotes are always placed around fields.
    - csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC means that quotes are always placed around nonnumeric fields.
    - csv.QUOTE_NONE means that quotes are never placed around fields.
- doublequote controls the handling of quotes inside fields.
    - When True two consecutive quotes are interpreted as one during read, and when writing, each quote is written as two quotes.
