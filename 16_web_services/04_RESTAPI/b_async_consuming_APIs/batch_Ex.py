"""
BATCH - How it works
async def get_location(address)
    1. Put the address on a queue of requests.
    2. Start a background task that:
        i. Waits a short time for other requests to be enqueued.
        ii. Processes all queued requests as a batch.
        iii. Notifies the waiting 'get_location' functions.
    3. Wait for the result and return it.
