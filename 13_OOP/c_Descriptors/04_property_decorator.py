"""
Purpose: newly style classes better support property decorator

To access a method as a variable, we need property decorator

Q) When to use @property decorator?
Ans) When an attribute is derived from other attributes in the class, so the
     derived attribute will update whenever the source attributes is changed.

Q) How to make a @property?
Ans) Make an attribute as property by defining it as a function and add the
     @property decorator before the fn definition.

Q) When to define a setter method for the property?
Ans) Typically, if you want to update the source attributes whenever the property
    is set. It lets you define any other changes as well.
