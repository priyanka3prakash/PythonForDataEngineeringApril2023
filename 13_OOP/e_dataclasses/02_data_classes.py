"""
Purpose: Data classes
  Introduced in python 3.7 (with PEP 557) to reduce the boilerplate code
  For 3.6, dataclasses can be used by installing as a module
                pip install dataclasses

"""
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass()
class Foo(object):
    x: int


f = Foo(12)
print(f"{f.x =}")
f.x = 1
f.y = 12  # Adding new attrbute to instance


try:
    print(hash(f))
except Exception as ex:
    print(ex)
    print("This instance is mutable. So, hash cant be created")


print("\nWith FROZEN =============")


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Foo2(object):
    x: int


f = Foo2(12)
print(f"{f.x =}")
# f.x = 1 # dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'x'
# f.y = 123 # dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'y'
print(hash(f))

# NOTE: Namedtuples are also dataclasses,
# but immutable by default
